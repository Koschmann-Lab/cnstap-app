# Introduction to CNS-TAP

The Central Nervous System Targeted Agent Prediction (CNS TAP) tool is a formalized decision-making algorithm to assist clinicians with selecting the optimal targeted therapy for neuro-oncology patients based on drug properties, clinical and pre-clinical data, and patient-specific sequencing data. The main article describing the underlying methodologies and evaluated criteria can be found here: [Development of the CNS TAP tool for the selection of precision medicine therapies in neuro-oncology. J Neurooncol. 2018;137(1):155-169](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29235051/).
